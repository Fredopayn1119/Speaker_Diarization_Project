# Feature Extraction Techniques

**Traditional Acoustic Features (MFCCs):** Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are a classic choice for speaker diarization. MFCCs capture the short-term spectral envelope of speech, which encodes vocal tract characteristics useful for distinguishing speakers ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=1,It%27s%20important%20to)). They are often used as frame-level inputs for diarization systems ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=1,It%27s%20important%20to)). Best practices include using a suitable window length (e.g. 25ms), hop length (10ms), and number of coefficients (typically 13) along with delta and delta-delta features. In PyTorch, the **Torchaudio** library provides an `MFCC` transform for convenient extraction ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=Improving%20Speaker%20Diarization%20with%20Self,features%20for%20speaker%20diarization%20systems)). For example, one can convert raw waveform to MFCC features on-the-fly using `torchaudio.transforms.MFCC`, which leverages GPU acceleration if available ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=Improving%20Speaker%20Diarization%20with%20Self,features%20for%20speaker%20diarization%20systems)). It’s important to apply pre-processing like pre-emphasis and mean normalization to MFCCs to improve robustness. Traditional MFCC-based diarization pipelines often also apply **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** to filter out non-speech before further processing ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=used%20as%20input%20features%20for,or%20speech%20segment%29%2C%20overlapping)). While MFCC features are easy to compute and interpretable, they may not separate speakers as cleanly in complex conditions, thus modern systems often augment or replace them with learned embeddings.

**Deep Learning-Based Speaker Embeddings:** Recent diarization systems rely on neural network embeddings that represent a speaker’s voice characteristics in a fixed-dimensional vector. Two popular embedding types are **x-vectors** and **d-vectors**, with newer self-supervised representations like **Wav2Vec** also being explored:

- **X-vectors:** X-vectors are embeddings produced by a deep neural network trained to discriminate between speakers ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=which%20map%20the%20acoustic%20features,embeddings%20are%20obtained%2C%20the%20clustering)). Introduced by Snyder et al. (2018), an x-vector DNN ingests acoustic features (e.g. MFCC or filterbanks) and uses a time-delay neural network (TDNN) to aggregate frame-level information into a fixed 512-D vector for each segment ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=which%20map%20the%20acoustic%20features,embeddings%20are%20obtained%2C%20the%20clustering)). The network is trained on large speaker-ID datasets (like VoxCeleb) to classify speaker identities, and the penultimate layer’s activations form the x-vector embedding ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=which%20map%20the%20acoustic%20features,embeddings%20are%20obtained%2C%20the%20clustering)). X-vectors have become a **de facto standard** in diarization pipelines due to their strong speaker-discriminative power ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=which%20map%20the%20acoustic%20features,embeddings%20are%20obtained%2C%20the%20clustering)). They can be extracted using toolkits like **Kaldi** or **SpeechBrain** (which offers a PyTorch implementation). For example, one end-to-end diarization approach uses a **pretrained x-vector model** to encode audio into embeddings, followed by Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to group them ([Speaker Diarization Using x-vectors
](https://www.mathworks.com/help/audio/ug/speaker-diarization-using-x-vectors.html#:~:text=In%20this%20example%2C%20you%20perform,vectors)). PyTorch implementations often reuse pretrained models – e.g. **Pyannote-Audio** provides a ready-to-use `SpeakerEmbedding` model trained to produce x-vector-like embeddings ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=for%20speaker%20recognition,An%20easier%20way%20to%20support)). When training x-vector models from scratch, best practices include data augmentation (to make embeddings robust) and careful normalization (e.g. mean subtraction, length normalization) before clustering ([ISCA Archive - Diarization is Hard: Some Experiences and Lessons Learned for the JHU Team in the Inaugural DIHARD Challenge](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2018/sell18_interspeech.html#:~:text=diarization%20methods%2C%20such%20as%20training,approach%20to%20diarization%20performance%20measurement)) ([ISCA Archive - Diarization is Hard: Some Experiences and Lessons Learned for the JHU Team in the Inaugural DIHARD Challenge](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2018/sell18_interspeech.html#:~:text=x,After%20presenting)).

- **D-vectors:** D-vectors refer to deep embeddings pioneered by Google’s **DeepSpeaker** approach, typically obtained by averaging frame-level outputs of an LSTM or CNN for a given speaker segment ([GitHub - resemble-ai/Resemblyzer: A python package to analyze and compare voices with deep learning](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer#:~:text=Resemblyzer%20allows%20you%20to%20derive,characteristics%20of%20the%20voice%20spoken)). A well-known implementation is the **Resemblyzer** toolkit, which provides a pre-trained voice encoder that produces 256-dimensional d-vectors ([GitHub - resemble-ai/Resemblyzer: A python package to analyze and compare voices with deep learning](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer#:~:text=Resemblyzer%20allows%20you%20to%20derive,characteristics%20of%20the%20voice%20spoken)). Given an input waveform, Resemblyzer’s model (inspired by GE2E loss training) outputs a vector summarizing that voice’s characteristics ([GitHub - resemble-ai/Resemblyzer: A python package to analyze and compare voices with deep learning](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer#:~:text=Resemblyzer%20allows%20you%20to%20derive,characteristics%20of%20the%20voice%20spoken)). These embeddings can then be compared (via cosine similarity) to link segments by speaker. The advantage of d-vectors is that they can be computed on any arbitrary-length audio and are straightforward to use for clustering. In practice, d-vectors and x-vectors serve similar purposes; x-vectors often outperform d-vectors on large datasets, but d-vectors are easier to obtain thanks to open-source projects like Resemblyzer ([GitHub - resemble-ai/Resemblyzer: A python package to analyze and compare voices with deep learning](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer#:~:text=Resemblyzer%20allows%20you%20to%20derive,characteristics%20of%20the%20voice%20spoken)). For PyTorch users, Resemblyzer (though implemented in TensorFlow) can be invoked via its Python API, or one can use **SpeechBrain** to train a similar embedding model with PyTorch. It’s recommended to project embeddings to unit length (normalize) before similarity comparisons, which both x-vector and d-vector pipelines commonly do ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=4,In%20such)).

- **Wav2Vec Embeddings:** **Wav2Vec 2.0** is a self-supervised model that learns general speech representations. While originally developed for ASR, its deep layers capture speaker characteristics useful for diarization. In practice, diarization systems use Wav2Vec in two ways: (1) as a feature extractor whose latent representations (e.g. contextual embeddings from a middle layer) feed into a speaker clustering model, or (2) fine-tuned as a speaker embedding extractor (e.g. via a `Wav2Vec2ForXVector` model). Researchers have found that using Wav2Vec 2.0’s learned features can outperform MFCCs ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=Feature%20type%20Parameters%20Unlabelled%20training,8)) ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=match%20at%20L170%20error%20metric,system%20can%20identify%20and%20attribute)) – for example, Speechmatics reports ~26-39% relative improvement in diarization metrics when replacing MFCCs with Wav2Vec-based features in a diarization system ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=Feature%20type%20Parameters%20Unlabelled%20training,8)). Hugging Face’s Transformers library provides **Wav2Vec2 models fine-tuned for speaker identification**, which output embeddings similar to x-vectors. One user reported success using `Wav2Vec2ForXVector` on audio chunks and then applying clustering, although the approach was sensitive to hyperparameters like the clustering threshold ([Diarization with unknown number of speakers - Models - Hugging Face Forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/diarization-with-unknown-number-of-speakers/17281#:~:text=number%20of%20speakers%20such%20as,Wav2Vec2ForAudioFrameClassification)). Best practice when using Wav2Vec or other deep features is to segment audio into short windows (e.g. 1.5 – 3 seconds) before embedding, to ensure each vector represents a single speaker; overlapping windows can improve robustness at speaker change boundaries ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=extracts%20speaker%20embeddings%20from%20the,dimensional)). With a MacBook M-series (Metal backend) or on Kaggle’s GPUs, one can leverage PyTorch’s efficient model inference to extract these embeddings for entire recordings.

**Implementation Tips:** For traditional features, libraries like **Librosa** (for MFCC) or **Torchaudio** are convenient – Librosa’s MFCC and delta features are commonly used in research prototypes, while Torchaudio integrates better with PyTorch dataloaders. Ensure all audio is resampled to a common sampling rate (e.g. 16kHz) before feature extraction so that features are consistent. When using deep embeddings, it’s often best to use **pre-trained models** if available (due to the large amount of data required to train them). Frameworks such as **Pyannote-Audio** (PyTorch) provide pretrained speaker embedding models that can be directly applied ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=for%20speaker%20recognition,An%20easier%20way%20to%20support)). Similarly, **SpeechBrain** offers recipes to train or use embeddings (they include an ECAPA-TDNN embedding model, which is an evolution of x-vectors). If TensorFlow is an option, the **UIS-RNN** paper’s authors released a pretrained d-vector model (not openly, but the concepts were implemented in examples) and there are TensorFlow 2 implementations of speaker encoders in community repos. In summary, start with MFCC or log-mel features to build a baseline, and then consider swapping in a stronger embedding (x-vector/d-vector) to improve speaker separability. Always remember to normalize features (both MFCCs and neural embeddings) as this greatly helps clustering algorithms to perform correctly by focusing on direction (cosine similarity) rather than vector magnitude differences.

## Clustering Techniques for Speaker Segmentation

After converting audio into a sequence of speaker-discriminative feature vectors, an unsupervised clustering method is typically used to group segments by speaker identity ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=4,In%20such)). The choice of clustering algorithm and the strategy for determining the number of speakers are crucial for diarization performance.

- **K-Means Clustering:** K-Means is a simple and fast clustering algorithm that has been applied to speaker diarization, especially when the number of speakers is known or fixed. It partitions embedding vectors into *K* clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance. K-Means (or its variant K-Means++ for better initialization) works reasonably when speaker embeddings form compact, spherical clusters. In practice, vanilla K-Means requires specifying *K* (the number of speakers). In two-speaker telephone conversations or known meeting scenarios, this can be set in advance ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=2,2%20speakers%2C%20a%20fixed%20number)). For unknown speaker count, one might run K-Means for a range of K values and use a criterion (like silhouette score or elbow method) to pick the best K, but this is computationally expensive for each recording. Some diarization pipelines simplify the problem by assuming a maximum number of speakers or by building a clustering dendrogram and cutting it at a learned threshold (effectively deciding K automatically – see Agglomerative Clustering below). Despite its simplicity, K-Means has been found competitive for small numbers of speakers ([Comparison of speaker clustering performance for various number of...](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Comparison-of-speaker-clustering-performance-for-various-number-of-speakers_tbl2_360215136#:~:text=Comparison%20of%20speaker%20clustering%20performance,researchers%20lack%20the%20motivation)). For example, one blog demonstrates using K-Means on segment embeddings (from Resemblyzer) to *simultaneously cluster and determine the number of speakers* in a conversation ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=match%20at%20L247%20,with%20each%20speakers%20time%20stamps)). In that approach, the algorithm was run with *K* equal to a likely upper bound, and the resulting clusters effectively revealed the true speaker count ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=match%20at%20L247%20,with%20each%20speakers%20time%20stamps)). However, caution is needed: if K is overestimated, K-Means will still output that many clusters, potentially over-segmenting one speaker into multiple clusters.

- **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC):** AHC is very popular in diarization research due to its flexibility in deciding the number of clusters based on a distance threshold. AHC starts with each embedding as its own cluster and iteratively merges the closest pair of clusters until a stopping criterion is met. Typically, the cosine distance or probabilistic distance (like PLDA score in speaker recognition systems) is used to measure cluster similarity ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=4,In%20such)). One can set a **distance threshold**: merging stops when the nearest cluster pair distance exceeds this threshold, thereby determining the number of clusters automatically. This approach was used in the winning JHU DIHARD challenge system – they clustered x-vectors with AHC, then refined with a second stage (VB-HMM) ([ISCA Archive - Diarization is Hard: Some Experiences and Lessons Learned for the JHU Team in the Inaugural DIHARD Challenge](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2018/sell18_interspeech.html#:~:text=diarization%20methods%2C%20such%20as%20training,approach%20to%20diarization%20performance%20measurement)) ([ISCA Archive - Diarization is Hard: Some Experiences and Lessons Learned for the JHU Team in the Inaugural DIHARD Challenge](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2018/sell18_interspeech.html#:~:text=x,After%20presenting)). Agglomerative clustering often yields good results when the embeddings form well-separated clusters, and the threshold can be tuned on a development set. MATLAB’s diarization example, for instance, uses pretrained x-vectors + AHC to group similar regions without knowing speaker count a priori ([Speaker Diarization Using x-vectors
](https://www.mathworks.com/help/audio/ug/speaker-diarization-using-x-vectors.html#:~:text=In%20this%20example%2C%20you%20perform,vectors)). In PyTorch or Python, one can use `sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering` with `distance_threshold` set instead of a fixed n_clusters – this will let the algorithm infer the number of speakers. The challenge is picking the right threshold: too low can over-split speakers, too high can merge distinct speakers ([Diarization with unknown number of speakers - Models - Hugging Face Forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/diarization-with-unknown-number-of-speakers/17281#:~:text=number%20of%20speakers%20such%20as,Wav2Vec2ForAudioFrameClassification)). Often, a threshold is learned by optimizing DER on a validation set or using domain knowledge (e.g. a threshold on cosine distance ~0.5 might correspond to a reasonable clustering for speaker embeddings). AHC is computationally more expensive than K-Means for large datasets (O(n^2) similarity checks), but for a single recording (where n = number of segments) it’s usually fine.

- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering):** DBSCAN is an algorithm that groups points that are closely packed and marks points in low-density regions as outliers. An attractive property of DBSCAN is that it **does not require specifying the number of clusters upfront** – instead, it needs a distance ε (epsilon) and a minimum samples parameter. If speaker embeddings form dense clusters in the vector space, DBSCAN can automatically identify them and even discard noise/outlier segments as “unassigned” if they don’t fit well into any cluster. Some researchers have tried DBSCAN for speaker diarization, especially in scenarios with unknown and variable number of speakers. The **HDBSCAN** (Hierarchical DBSCAN) algorithm extends this to automatically choose epsilon by building a hierarchy; it has been applied in at least one diarization study, effectively performing a form of hierarchical clustering without a preset cluster count ([](https://pvarshney1729.github.io/projects/Report_EE698.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%205%20LSTM%20based%20Models,have%20been%20chosen%20by%20VAD)) ([](https://pvarshney1729.github.io/projects/Report_EE698.pdf#:~:text=,speech%20segments%20assigned%200%29%202)). The upside is less parameter tuning for number of speakers; the downside is that if embeddings from two different speakers are not well-separated (e.g. very similar voices or short segments), DBSCAN might merge them if its density parameters aren’t carefully set. In practice, DBSCAN hasn’t been as widely used as AHC in published systems, but it remains a viable option for an embedding space that exhibits clear density separation.

- **Spectral Clustering:** Spectral clustering is another powerful method frequently used with speaker embeddings, especially in combination with cosine similarity or PLDA affinity matrices ([[PDF] A Spectral Clustering Approach to Speaker Diarization - ISCA Archive](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2006/ning06_interspeech.pdf#:~:text=Archive%20www.isca,learning%20a%20mixture%20model)). It works by constructing a similarity graph of all embedding vectors and finding the optimal graph partition (clustering) via eigen-decomposition of the Laplacian matrix. One advantage is the ability to capture non-spherical cluster structures, which can be useful if speaker embeddings lie on a manifold. Spectral methods have shown robust performance, for example in diarization systems for the VoxConverse challenge ([Comparison of speaker clustering performance for various number of...](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Comparison-of-speaker-clustering-performance-for-various-number-of-speakers_tbl2_360215136#:~:text=Comparison%20of%20speaker%20clustering%20performance,researchers%20lack%20the%20motivation)). A specific technique is **Eigen-gap heuristic**: one can run spectral clustering and look at the eigenvalues to automatically infer the number of clusters by finding the largest gap between successive eigenvalues ([Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering for Speaker Diarization](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00023v1#:~:text=tuning%20data%20as%20the%20pruning,tuning%20approaches)). In fact, a recent study introduced an *auto-tuning spectral clustering* that prunes the affinity matrix and selects cluster count via the maximum eigengap, eliminating the need for a separate development set ([Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering for Speaker Diarization](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00023v1#:~:text=tuning%20data%20as%20the%20pruning,tuning%20approaches)) ([Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering for Speaker Diarization](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00023v1#:~:text=affinity%20matrix%2C%20and%20retains%20only,tuning%20approaches)). Spectral clustering tends to be more computationally expensive (it involves operations on an n×n similarity matrix), but with optimizations and for reasonable n (segments count), it’s manageable on modern hardware, including on a Kaggle GPU if needed. Many state-of-the-art diarization frameworks (e.g. Pyannote) default to spectral clustering on cosine-similarity matrices of embeddings, as it often outperforms simpler methods for larger numbers of speakers. The key is to post-process the affinity matrix carefully (e.g. threshold small similarities to zero) to improve results ([Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering for Speaker Diarization](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00023v1#:~:text=Spectral%20clustering%20has%20proven%20effective,derived%20directly%20from%20the%20affinity)) ([Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering for Speaker Diarization](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00023v1#:~:text=speaker%20diarization%20tasks%2C%20although%20post,Spectral%20clustering%20is%20performed%20subsequently)).

**Determining the Number of Speakers:** This is a central challenge in diarization when not known in advance. Approaches include:

- **Threshold-Based Stopping (for AHC):** As mentioned, choose a similarity threshold in hierarchical clustering. This threshold can be tuned by optimizing DER on a development set with known speakers, effectively learning how far apart same-speaker embeddings typically are. During inference, the algorithm stops merging when distances exceed that threshold, yielding an inferred speaker count. This is perhaps the most common strategy in modular pipelines (e.g., Kaldi’s diarization recipe uses a PLDA score threshold learned on dev data ([Speaker Diarization Using x-vectors
](https://www.mathworks.com/help/audio/ug/speaker-diarization-using-x-vectors.html#:~:text=,2812%2C%20DOI))).

- **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):** Older diarization systems used BIC to decide if and where to split clusters. BIC can compare models of the audio as *K* vs *K+1* speakers and decide if increasing clusters is justified by the data likelihood (penalized for model complexity). This method can be applied incrementally to determine when to stop merging or splitting clusters. It was more popular in GMM/i-vector era diarization, but less common now with DNN embeddings.

- **Eigenvector Analysis:** With spectral clustering, as noted, the eigengap method is used – essentially looking at the sorted eigenvalues of the affinity matrix; if the largest gap is after the *j*-th eigenvalue, one selects *j* clusters. This has some theoretical grounding and has been shown to work well on datasets like DIHARD III for auto-tuning cluster counts ([Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering for Speaker Diarization](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00023v1#:~:text=tuning%20data%20as%20the%20pruning,tuning%20approaches)).

- **Silhouette or Cluster Quality Metrics:** In scenarios where one can do multiple runs, you might compute the silhouette score for different candidate *K* and choose the K with the highest average silhouette (meaning clusters are tight and well-separated). Similarly, the **elbow method** might be employed on the sum of squared distances (for K-means) to find a point where adding more clusters yields diminishing returns ([A2 description.pdf](file://file-1mqsxTqvRsLkaaGdpNBEff#:~:text=identify%20natural%20groupings%20within%20the,guide%20your%20choice%20of%20K)). These methods, however, may be unreliable on short recordings or when clusters are not clearly separable.

- **Deep Learning Approaches:** There are emerging methods where a model predicts the number of speakers directly. For example, some end-to-end diarization models or sequence-to-sequence models output not just “who spoke when” but also implicitly learn the count (or use an attractor mechanism that can create as many attractors as there are speakers) ([[PDF] Improving End-to-End Neural Diarization Using Conversational ...](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2023/broughton23_interspeech.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20Improving%20End,speakers%20in%20a%20given)). Google’s UIS-RNN, while primarily a clustering method, can handle an unknown number of speakers by learning when to create a new cluster vs assign to existing (it’s somewhat guided by training data with varying speaker counts) ([GitHub - google/uis-rnn: This is the library for the Unbounded Interleaved-State Recurrent Neural Network (UIS-RNN) algorithm, corresponding to the paper Fully Supervised Speaker Diarization.](https://github.com/google/uis-rnn#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20library%20for,data%20by%20learning%20from%20examples)). Another approach is using a classifier on the whole recording to estimate speaker count as a separate step (e.g. feeding an overall embedding or statistics into a small DNN that outputs 1, 2, 3… speaker count estimate).

In summary, a **common strategy** in many diarization systems is: extract embeddings for short speech segments (like 1-2 seconds), then use Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering with a tuned threshold to automatically infer speaker groups ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=4,In%20such)). This is a solid baseline known to work well for 2-10 speaker meetings. For more complex scenarios, spectral clustering with an eigen-gap heuristic might improve consistency in speaker-count estimation ([Self-Tuning Spectral Clustering for Speaker Diarization](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00023v1#:~:text=affinity%20matrix%2C%20and%20retains%20only,tuning%20approaches)). It’s also advisable to **manually inspect or validate** the chosen number of clusters on a few examples (e.g. listen to see if clearly different speakers got separated or if one speaker was mistakenly split) when developing the system, since clustering outcomes can sometimes be unintuitive.

**Comparative Effectiveness:** Different clustering algorithms can yield different diarization error rates (DER). Studies have shown that for **few speakers (2-3)**, simple methods like K-Means or AHC perform comparably to spectral clustering ([Comparison of speaker clustering performance for various number of...](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Comparison-of-speaker-clustering-performance-for-various-number-of-speakers_tbl2_360215136#:~:text=Comparison%20of%20speaker%20clustering%20performance,researchers%20lack%20the%20motivation)). However, as the number of speakers grows or the conversation domain becomes complex (overlapping speech, noise, etc.), spectral clustering or model-based clustering (like VB-HMM) tend to outperform. For example, an MIT paper compared K-means (cosine distance) vs spectral clustering and found spectral handled non-linear separations better, particularly when clusters are not well-separated in a simple metric space ([[PDF] On the Use of Spectral and Iterative Methods for Speaker Diarization](https://sls.csail.mit.edu/publications/2012/Shum-Interspeech12.pdf#:~:text=Diarization%20sls,Our%20subsequent)). The JHU DIHARD challenge report noted that their best system used **x-vectors + AHC + VB refinement**, suggesting that pure clustering was enhanced by a model that accounts for speaker turn probabilities (VB-HMM) ([ISCA Archive - Diarization is Hard: Some Experiences and Lessons Learned for the JHU Team in the Inaugural DIHARD Challenge](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2018/sell18_interspeech.html#:~:text=diarization%20methods%2C%20such%20as%20training,approach%20to%20diarization%20performance%20measurement)). In practical terms, if you’re building a PyTorch-based diarizer, you might start with AHC (easy to implement via sklearn or scipy linkage) and evaluate DER. If DER is too high due to clustering errors, consider trying spectral clustering (there are Python libraries for it, or implement via eigen-decomposition with numpy/PyTorch) to see if it better separates the embeddings. Also, pay attention to **overlap** segments: standard clustering assumes each frame belongs to one speaker at a time; if your data has overlapping speech, special handling (like treating overlap segments separately or using overlap-aware diarization techniques) may be needed to avoid confusing the clusters.

## Datasets for Speaker Diarization

Building and evaluating a diarization system requires datasets that contain multi-speaker audio with ground truth “who spoke when” annotations. Below are common **open-source datasets** used in speaker diarization research, along with their characteristics:

- **AMI Meeting Corpus:** A widely-used dataset of **meeting recordings** (100 hours) with 3-5 speakers per session ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Audio)). The meetings are in English, recorded with multiple microphones (including close-talking mics and an array). Ground truth diarization labels (time-stamped speaker segments) are provided, often in NIST RTTM format. AMI is free to download for research from the University of Edinburgh’s website ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Audio)). This corpus features natural multi-party interactions, reasonable audio quality, and has become a standard benchmark for diarization – many tutorials and papers use AMI for experiments. It’s a good starting dataset, as it includes both audio and reference transcripts with speaker labels.

- **NIST CALLHOME Corpus:** A collection of **telephone conversations** (approx 17 hours) with 2 to 7 speakers per call, though typically 2 on the phone at once ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Dataset%20Hours%20Speakers%20Overlap%28,72%20%2433%2C000)). It contains casual conversations in English. CALLHOME has been popular in early diarization research. The LDC provides the audio (LDC2001S97) and a text file with reference speaker turns; an RTTM reference is available via NIST or OpenSLR ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Notes%3A)). Although the audio is relatively clean telephone speech, diarization is challenging due to short back-and-forth turns. CALLHOME is useful for evaluating diarization where there are many short speaker turns and where speaker count can vary up to 6 or 7 in some mixes.

- **DIHARD Challenge Datasets:** The DIHARD series (I, II, III) are diarization challenge datasets designed to be **very difficult**, featuring varied domains (restaurant noise, child speech, meeting, web videos, etc.) and lots of overlapping speech. DIHARD II, for example, has 46 hours with 2–14 speakers in a session ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Dataset%20Hours%20Speakers%20Overlap%28,72%20%2433%2C000)). They come with oracle VAD labels and rich annotation (including overlap regions). Parts of DIHARD datasets can be downloaded (some portions were released for challenge participants; the full sets are available via LDC with a fee) ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Dataset%20Hours%20Speakers%20Overlap%28,72%20%2433%2C000)). These datasets are great for testing how robust your system is to real-world conditions (e.g. very short turns, laughter, crosstalk). A downside is they often require robust VAD and overlap handling to get decent DER.

- **VoxConverse:** An **audio-visual diarization dataset** (~64 hours) collected from YouTube videos, released by the University of Oxford. It contains a wide range of open-domain videos (panel discussions, interviews, etc.) with **1 to 21 speakers** in a recording ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Audio)). VoxConverse provides audio, video, and diarization annotations (the visual face tracks can also be used, but audio alone is sufficient). It’s freely available (the audio and labels can be downloaded – e.g. via the VoxConverse page on Hugging Face Datasets) ([joonson/voxconverse - speaker diarisation in the wild - GitHub](https://github.com/joonson/voxconverse#:~:text=VoxConverse%20is%20an%20audio,speech%2C%20extracted%20from%20YouTube%20videos)) ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Audio)). VoxConverse is challenging due to its “in the wild” nature – varying audio quality, sometimes very short speaker turns, and a high potential number of speakers. It’s been used in recent diarization challenges (VoxSRC diarization tracks). If your goal is to push a system to handle unconstrained scenarios, VoxConverse is a prime test set.

- **Others:** There are many other datasets; a curated list is maintained in the community ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Audio)). For example, **ICSI Meeting Corpus** (another meeting dataset like AMI, but older), **CHIME-5/6** (dinner party conversations with multi-microphone recordings), **Aura Corpus** (multi-speaker corporate meetings), **AliMeeting** (a Mandarin meeting corpus), and **LibriCSS** (constructed from LibriSpeech to simulate meeting-style overlap). Some datasets focus on specific conditions: e.g., **CSSD** (Chinese Strongly Supervised Dataset) is a Chinese 2-speaker corpus with no overlaps ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Label%20%24300%20CSSD%20180%202,72%20%2433%2C000)), and **MISP** is a multi-microphone Mandarin meeting corpus ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Dataset%20Hours%20Speakers%20Overlap%28,7%20Chinese%20Data%20Label%20Free)). Depending on the project’s focus, you’d pick a dataset that matches your target use-case (for instance, AMI for business meetings, CALLHOME for phone calls, VoxConverse for media). 

- **Speaker Identification Datasets (for training embeddings):** In addition to diarization corpora, large **speaker recognition** datasets are used to train the embedding extractors. The most famous is **VoxCeleb1 & VoxCeleb2**, which contain thousands of speakers and hundreds of thousands of utterances extracted from YouTube interviews. VoxCeleb is **not a diarization dataset** (each clip is mostly single-speaker), but it provides labeled speaker excerpts for training models like x-vectors or d-vectors. Any diarization project that involves training a new embedding model will likely make use of VoxCeleb (free to download from the VoxCeleb website) as training data. Likewise, the **NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE) datasets** and **Fisher** datasets have been used historically to train i-vector and x-vector models – these often require LDC licenses. If using a pretrained embedding model, the authors likely already used these resources; but if you plan to train your own in PyTorch, having a large corpus like VoxCeleb is important for good results.

When starting out, a good approach is to **download a relatively small but representative dataset** (e.g., a subset of AMI or a few CALLHOME recordings) to prototype your pipeline. You can later scale up to the full datasets once the code is working. Most datasets will provide reference files (like RTTM or CTM) with speaker labels per time segment – these are essential for scoring your diarization output (for example, using `pyannote.metrics` to compute DER). If a dataset’s audio is not pre-segmented, you’ll need to apply VAD to create segments before embedding extraction; some corpora like AMI might come with pre-annotated segments (speech turns) which you can use to avoid doing VAD during training or analysis.

## Code Implementations & Repositories

Implementing a full diarization pipeline from scratch can be complex, but there are many open-source projects and codebases that provide building blocks or even complete solutions. Focusing on PyTorch-based implementations and related tools:

- **Pyannote-Audio (GitHub)** – *Neural building blocks for speaker diarization.* Pyannote-Audio ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=for%20speaker%20recognition,An%20easier%20way%20to%20support)) is a comprehensive PyTorch toolkit by Hervé Bredin. It provides pretrained models and pipelines for **speech activity detection (SAD)**, **speaker change detection (SCD)**, **overlap detection**, and **speaker embedding** extraction ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=for%20speaker%20recognition,An%20easier%20way%20to%20support)). Essentially, it has all pieces for a diarization system. For example, you can use a pretrained **speaker embedding model** from pyannote (which functions similarly to an x-vector network) and then apply pyannote’s clustering pipeline (they often use spectral clustering by default). Pyannote’s GitHub also has example notebooks and a CLI to perform diarization on your own audio. This toolkit is highly modular – you can swap in your own model or tune the hyperparameters. It’s a great reference for how to structure a diarization pipeline in PyTorch.

- **SpeechBrain (GitHub)** – *All-in-one speech toolkit (PyTorch)*. SpeechBrain ([Introducing SpeechBrain: A General-Purpose PyTorch Speech Processing Toolkit | Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/article/introducing-speechbrain-a-general-purpose-pytorch-speech-processing-toolkit#:~:text=What%20is%20SpeechBrain%3F)) ([Introducing SpeechBrain: A General-Purpose PyTorch Speech Processing Toolkit | Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/article/introducing-speechbrain-a-general-purpose-pytorch-speech-processing-toolkit#:~:text=,speaker%20identities%20from%20speech%20recordings)) includes recipes for speaker recognition and even speaker diarization. For instance, SpeechBrain’s Speaker Recognition module has an ECAPA-TDNN embedding model (an advanced x-vector variant) that can be used for diarization. While SpeechBrain’s diarization recipe is not as famous as Pyannote’s, the toolkit is well-documented, and you might find ready-made training scripts for embeddings and even a basic clustering approach. SpeechBrain emphasizes **modularity and reproducibility**, so it’s a good example of project structure too. It’s maintained by a community including folks at MILA and is friendly to adaptation on both CPU (like Apple M-series) and GPU.

- **Resemblyzer** – *Deep learning voice embeddings.* Resemblyzer ([GitHub - resemble-ai/Resemblyzer: A python package to analyze and compare voices with deep learning](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer#:~:text=Resemblyzer%20allows%20you%20to%20derive,characteristics%20of%20the%20voice%20spoken)) is a Python package that simplifies obtaining d-vector embeddings. It’s not a full diarization system by itself, but it provides functions to segment audio and compare embeddings to cluster speakers. For example, it has a demo for speaker diarization that uses a pretrained encoder to get 256-dim embeddings and then does simple clustering on them ([GitHub - resemble-ai/Resemblyzer: A python package to analyze and compare voices with deep learning](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer#:~:text=Demos)). Under the hood, Resemblyzer’s model is based on a TensorFlow implementation of GE2E, but the package is easy to install (`pip install resemblyzer`) and can be invoked alongside PyTorch code. Many beginners use Resemblyzer for a quick way to “get who’s speaking” without training a model. Since it’s open source (Apache 2.0), you can even examine how it does VAD, segmentation, and clustering in its code – this can guide your own implementation.

- **UIS-RNN (GitHub by Google)** – *Fully supervised speaker diarization with RNN.* The UIS-RNN algorithm ([GitHub - google/uis-rnn: This is the library for the Unbounded Interleaved-State Recurrent Neural Network (UIS-RNN) algorithm, corresponding to the paper Fully Supervised Speaker Diarization.](https://github.com/google/uis-rnn#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20library%20for,data%20by%20learning%20from%20examples)) is an interesting alternative to traditional clustering. It trains an RNN to sequentially decide if a new speech segment belongs to an existing speaker or a new speaker, thus performing diarization as a sequence labeling problem. Google released a GitHub repo for UIS-RNN ([GitHub - google/uis-rnn: This is the library for the Unbounded Interleaved-State Recurrent Neural Network (UIS-RNN) algorithm, corresponding to the paper Fully Supervised Speaker Diarization.](https://github.com/google/uis-rnn#:~:text=Overview)) (written in Python, using PyTorch 1.3) which can be integrated with embeddings (the authors used d-vectors from a speaker encoder). The repo contains a **demo script** demonstrating how to take embeddings (extracted from audio using a separate speaker-id model) and apply UIS-RNN to cluster them over time ([uisrnn API documentation - Google](https://google.github.io/uis-rnn/uisrnn.html#:~:text=uisrnn%20API%20documentation%20,concatenated%20sequence%2C%20which%20is)) ([GitHub - google/uis-rnn: This is the library for the Unbounded Interleaved-State Recurrent Neural Network (UIS-RNN) algorithm, corresponding to the paper Fully Supervised Speaker Diarization.](https://github.com/google/uis-rnn#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20library%20for,data%20by%20learning%20from%20examples)). While UIS-RNN might be overkill for simple tasks, it’s valuable if you want to incorporate temporal constraints (e.g. speakers tend to continue speaking in contiguous segments) into clustering. It’s also one way to handle an **unknown number of speakers** dynamically. Keep in mind you need training data (with labeled sequences) to train the UIS-RNN model – the authors used simulated mixtures of VoxCeleb recordings for that.

- **End-to-End Diarization (EEND)** – *Transformer-based diarization.* There are end-to-end models (like EEND by Fujita et al.) that treat diarization as a multi-label prediction problem on frame level, using attractor mechanisms to handle multiple speakers ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=have%20been%20devised%20over%20the,methods%20have%20demonstrated%20their%20power)) ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=However%2C%20speaker%20diarization%20systems%20which,complex%20preparation%20processes%20involved%20earlier)). The original EEND code was in Chainer, but newer implementations exist in PyTorch (for example, a repo called **DiaPer** provides a PyTorch implementation of a Perceiver-based EEND model ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=engine%20written%20in%20C%20and,to%20speech%20on%20various))). End-to-end models can handle overlapping speech naturally and don’t require an explicit clustering step. If interested, check out the **EEND GitHub** ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=Python%20Speaker%20diarization%20using%20uis,it%20allows%20the%20user%20to)) which has recipes and maybe pretrained models. These systems are more complex to train (require large amounts of multi-speaker mixed audio for training), but repositories often include pre-trained models you can evaluate on standard data.

- **Variational Bayes X-vector (VBx) diarization** – This is a hybrid approach where x-vectors are clustered using a probabilistic model (VB-HMM). The VBx GitHub ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=EEND%20Image%3A%20GitHub%20stars%20Python,StreamingSpeakerDiarization%20%20223%20Image%3A%20GitHub)) provides Python code to perform VB clustering given a set of x-vectors for an audio file. It also links to a Kaldi **recipe** for training the x-vector extractor on VoxCeleb ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=EEND%20Image%3A%20GitHub%20stars%20Python,StreamingSpeakerDiarization%20%20223%20Image%3A%20GitHub)). While VBx might require some expertise to tune, it’s known to produce strong results on challenging data (used in some VoxConverse challenge entries). If you have x-vectors extracted (e.g. via Pyannote or SpeechBrain), you could feed them into VBx’s clustering as an alternative to KMeans/AHC. The repository includes example scripts and is implemented mostly in Python/C++.

- **Sample Diarization Pipelines:** There are several smaller repositories that assemble available tools into end-to-end pipelines. For example, **`simple_diarizer`** ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=StreamingSpeakerDiarization%20Image%3A%20GitHub%20stars%20Python,running%20on%20CPU%20with%20minimal)) is a Python repo that tries to make it easy to go from an input audio file to diarized segments using pretrained models (it likely uses Pyannote under the hood). Another one is **Picovoice Falcon** (a C/Python diarization engine) which is optimized for real-time use ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=pyannote,on%20CPU%20with%20minimal%20overhead)). These can serve as references or even as baselines to compare against. For instance, you could run `simple_diarizer` on your data to get an initial result, then implement your own pipeline and compare DER.

- **Evaluation Tools:** Don’t forget tools for scoring diarization output. The **pyannote.metrics** library ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=To%20evaluate%20the%20performance%20or,before%20and%20after%20the%20boundary)) ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=Diarization%20error%20rate%20,speech)) is a convenient way in Python to calculate Diarization Error Rate (and its components) given your system output and reference. There is also **SimpleDER** ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=Link%20Language%20Description%20pyannote,DiarizationLM%20Image%3A%20GitHub%20stars)), a lightweight library for computing DER if you have outputs in RTTM format. These repositories ensure you measure performance correctly, including handling of scoring collars, overlap, etc., as per standard practices ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=time,before%20and%20after%20the%20boundary)) ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=The%20DER%20is%20composed%20of,the%20following%20three%20errors)).

All these resources can be run on common hardware. On a MacBook Pro with an M4 (M-series) chip, you can use frameworks that support Apple’s Metal (PyTorch does, via the MPS backend). Pyannote and SpeechBrain should work on CPU-only if needed (with possibly slower embedding extraction). For heavier experiments, offloading to Kaggle’s GPU kernels or Colab is wise – many of the above repos (Pyannote, EEND, etc.) have been tested in such environments. For example, the UIS-RNN repo even includes notes about being used in Colab. Always check the README and issues of these repos for any platform-specific tips (e.g., Pyannote might require certain dependency versions, and for Apple M-series you might need to set environment variables to force CPU if something isn’t yet M1-optimized).

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

 ([Reference — pyannote.metrics 4.0.0rc3.dev0+g3b47364.d20250219 documentation](https://pyannote.github.io/pyannote-metrics/reference.html)) *A typical speaker diarization pipeline, consisting of modules for voice activity detection, segmentation, embedding extraction, clustering, and (optionally) speaker identification ([Reference — pyannote.metrics 4.0.0rc3.dev0+g3b47364.d20250219 documentation](https://pyannote.github.io/pyannote-metrics/reference.html#:~:text=The%20first%20step%20is%20usually,cluster%20in%20a%20supervised%20way)). In an implementation plan, each of these steps can be developed and evaluated independently before integrating into an end-to-end system.*  

**1. Study Foundations and Tutorials:** Begin by strengthening your understanding of speaker diarization fundamentals. Read a few key papers: for example, **“Speaker Diarization: A Review of Objectives and Methods”** (a survey paper) for an overview of techniques, and **Snyder et al. (2018)** on x-vectors ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=which%20map%20the%20acoustic%20features,embeddings%20are%20obtained%2C%20the%20clustering)) to understand how neural embeddings are trained for speaker recognition. The paper *“Diarization is Hard”* by Sell et al. (Interspeech 2018) provides insights into the challenges of diarization and lessons from the DIHARD challenge ([ISCA Archive - Diarization is Hard: Some Experiences and Lessons Learned for the JHU Team in the Inaugural DIHARD Challenge](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2018/sell18_interspeech.html#:~:text=diarization%20methods%2C%20such%20as%20training,approach%20to%20diarization%20performance%20measurement)) – this can calibrate your expectations on what’s tricky (overlaps, noise, etc.). Alongside papers, follow an online tutorial or course segment on diarization: for instance, Hervé Bredin’s JSALT lecture on YouTube ([Speaker diarization -- Herve Bredin -- JSALT 2023 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWdqxNDSg1k#:~:text=Speaker%20diarization%20,Ultimate%20Free%20AI%20Research%20Tool)) or the **Speaker Diarization & Voice Identification** tutorial that uses PyTorch (TorchAudio) on YouTube ([Speaker Diarization & Voice Identification Explained - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NCfX9CthTk#:~:text=Speaker%20Diarization%20%26%20Voice%20Identification,this%20video%2C%20I%27ll%20walk)). These will demonstrate actual code and methodology. Another great resource is the official **Pyannote Audio tutorial** notebooks, which walk through performing diarization with their pretrained models (you can find these in the pyannote documentation or on Hugging Face). By the end of this study phase, you should know the meaning of terms like VAD, DER, embedding, and have seen a simple diarization pipeline in action.

**2. Setup and Data Preparation:** Choose one or two datasets as your development data. For example, download a portion of the **AMI corpus** (meetings) or some **CALLHOME** audio. Ensure you have the **ground truth RTTM files** or transcripts with speaker labels for those – for AMI, these can be obtained from the corpus website (free) ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Audio)), and for CALLHOME, the RTTMs are available via NIST or OpenSLR ([GitHub - liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset: Both audio-only and audio-visual speaker diarization datasets are listed here.](https://github.com/liutaocode/AwesomeDiarizationDataset#:~:text=Notes%3A)). Convert all audio to a consistent format (e.g. 16 kHz WAV, mono). If the data is long audio recordings, decide on how you will handle segmentation: either use provided segment boundaries or run a **Voice Activity Detection** model to break audio into speech regions ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=used%20as%20input%20features%20for,or%20speech%20segment%29%2C%20overlapping)). You can start with a pre-trained VAD (for instance, Pyannote has a model that you can apply to get timestamps of speech). After VAD, **split the audio into manageable segments** (like 1-2 seconds long if using embeddings, or shorter if using frame-level features). It’s useful to store these segments (or their start-end times) along with the speaker label (for training) or as unlabeled (for inference). At this stage, implement a simple MFCC extraction on the segments and perhaps plot a couple of spectrograms or MFCCs to ensure your processing is correct (this is a sanity check – the features should look reasonable, e.g. voiced regions having higher energy in lower MFCC coefficients, etc.).

**3. Implement Feature Extraction Module:** Create a module (or script) for feature extraction that given an audio segment outputs the features needed by your model. For a baseline, this could be MFCCs or log-mel filterbanks. You can use **Torchaudio** transforms to do this within PyTorch ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=Improving%20Speaker%20Diarization%20with%20Self,features%20for%20speaker%20diarization%20systems)) – this ensures it’s easily integrable with PyTorch training loops (if any). Verify that your MFCC implementation matches standard configurations used in literature: e.g. 13 coefficients + energy, with delta and delta-delta (which would result in a 39-dim feature vector per frame). If you plan to use neural embeddings (x-vectors), decide whether you will (a) use a pretrained model to generate embeddings or (b) train your own. Option (a) is faster: for example, load a pretrained **Wav2Vec2ForXVector** from Hugging Face and use it to transform each segment into a 512-d vector ([Diarization with unknown number of speakers - Models - Hugging Face Forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/diarization-with-unknown-number-of-speakers/17281#:~:text=number%20of%20speakers%20such%20as,Wav2Vec2ForAudioFrameClassification)). Option (b) requires a large training corpus (like VoxCeleb). Assuming you go with a pretrained model initially, write a small script to loop through all speech segments, run the model to get embeddings, and save these embeddings (perhaps as numpy arrays or torch tensors). Ensure to **normalize** the embeddings (L2 normalization) if the model doesn’t already, as this often improves clustering ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=4,In%20such)). This module should be well-structured so that later you can swap in different features (for example, try MFCC vs x-vector easily by changing a flag).

**4. Develop the Clustering Algorithm:** Now, implement the clustering step that will take a set of embeddings for an audio file and produce speaker labels for each segment. Start with a simple approach like **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering** using cosine distance. You can use `scikit-learn`’s AgglomerativeClustering with `affinity='cosine'` and `linkage='average'`. Initially, you might assume a fixed number of speakers for testing – e.g., if using a meeting from AMI that you know has 4 speakers, tell the algorithm to produce 4 clusters and see how it performs. Then, move to the unknown-number scenario: switch to `distance_threshold` mode and play with that threshold. Use the ground truth to guide you – for a development recording, you can adjust the threshold until the predicted number of clusters matches the truth (or yields best DER). Implement this in a function `cluster_embeddings(embeddings)` that returns cluster labels. Also consider implementing an alternative like **K-Means** for comparison (using PyTorch’s k-means or sklearn’s). If ambitious, try out **DBSCAN** (from sklearn) to see if it auto-determines speaker count reasonably. At this step, it’s very useful to evaluate clustering quality in a simple way: since you have ground truth for dev data, you can calculate the clustering accuracy (how many segments were correctly grouped). If using K-means with a guessed K, a confusion matrix between predicted cluster vs true speaker can reveal if one cluster is pure or mixed. Iterate on this – for example, if you see two true speakers consistently merged into one cluster, maybe your threshold is too high or your embeddings aren’t discriminative enough (which might prompt using a better embedding or adding a subsequent re-segmentation step).

**5. Integrate Diarization Pipeline:** Once you have VAD → embeddings → clustering working separately, integrate them into an end-to-end system that takes raw audio and outputs diarization results. This means writing code that for each input audio file, does: run VAD (get speech segments), for each segment get embedding, cluster all embeddings, and finally assign cluster labels back to time intervals. The output can be formatted as an RTTM file (which lists for each speaker label, the time intervals they speak). At this point, it’s crucial to handle edge cases: ensure that very short segments or silence segments are filtered out (they can confuse clustering). Also, consider a **smoothing/post-processing** step – e.g., if two adjacent segments have the same cluster, you might merge them into one continuous segment for a cleaner output. This integrated pipeline can be first tested on a short audio where you *know* the result (even a synthetic example: record 2 people speaking one after the other). This will let you verify that the time-stamps and labels align with expectations (for example, check that when speaker changes, your system indeed outputs different labels). If something is off (like too many speaker changes), inspect intermediate outputs (embedding similarities, etc.).

**6. Experiment and Refine (Iteration):** With the basic pipeline in place, run it on a larger evaluation set and measure Diarization Error Rate. Use a library like `pyannote.metrics` to compute DER, or write a small evaluation script that compares your RTTM with ground truth RTTM ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=Diarization%20error%20rate%20,speech)) ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=The%20DER%20is%20composed%20of,the%20following%20three%20errors)). Analyze the errors: DER is composed of missed speech, false alarm, and confusion (speaker mis-assignments) ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=The%20DER%20is%20composed%20of,the%20following%20three%20errors)) ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=False%20Alarm%3A%20It%20is%20the,to%20segmentation%20and%20clustering%20errors)). If **missed speech or false alarm** is high, your VAD might be at fault (missing some speech or including noise as speech). If **speaker confusion** is high, your clustering/embeddings are the issue (mixing up speakers). This analysis will guide next steps. For VAD issues, you might try a better VAD model or tune its threshold. For confusion issues, possible improvements include: using a more powerful embedding (e.g., fine-tune Wav2Vec on your data for speaker classification, or use an ensemble of MFCC+embedding features), or applying a resegmentation step. Resegmentation is an optional post-clustering refinement where you train a small model (like an HMM or even a neural network) to adjust segment boundaries and labels by examining acoustic continuity ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=Resegmentation)). An easier form of resegmentation is doing another pass of clustering on a finer time scale (e.g., frame-level) within each cluster to see if a cluster should be split. At minimum, consider merging short segments labeled as a distinct speaker if they’re surrounded by another speaker – such errors often are false splits. Each tweak you implement, re-evaluate DER to see if it helped.

**7. Scaling Up and Utilizing Resources:** As your system stabilizes, scale up to more data or more difficult data. Use your Kaggle cloud resources to run heavier experiments – for example, training a new model. If you decide to train your own embedding network (say an x-vector), set up a training pipeline with a dataset like VoxCeleb2. This would involve writing a PyTorch training script with a dataset loader that yields mel-spectrogram frames and speaker labels, a TDNN or CNN model definition, and a training loop (optionally use PyTorch Lightning to simplify boilerplate). Leverage the GPU on Kaggle for this; you might train for many epochs and periodically evaluate the embeddings on a validation set (maybe using a simple PLDA or cosine scoring to monitor improvement). While this is a large task, it can be done incrementally – e.g., first train on a smaller subset to ensure the code works. Meanwhile, structure your project repository with clarity: have separate modules for **data (data preparation, feature pipelines)**, **models (definition of networks for embedding or VAD)**, and **evaluation (DER computation, visualization)**. Follow best practices like keeping configuration in one place (you can use JSON/YAML or even Python argparse to handle hyperparameters). This way, running experiments (like “train embedding with config A” vs “with config B”) becomes easier by just editing a config.

**8. Refer Back to Theory as Needed:** During implementation, you’ll likely encounter times when the system isn’t performing as expected. This is when revisiting theory and literature helps. For instance, if clustering isn’t separating speakers well, re-read the sections of a textbook or paper on **clustering evaluation** – maybe try calculating the **silhouette coefficient** for your clustering output to see if the clusters are well-formed. If DER is high due to many short confusion errors, study the DER breakdown – you might recall from literature that a collar (for scoring tolerance) is used ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=time,before%20and%20after%20the%20boundary)) ([Speaker Diarization | Skit Tech](https://tech.skit.ai/speaker-diarization/#:~:text=The%20DER%20is%20composed%20of,the%20following%20three%20errors)); ensure you apply a 0.25 or 0.5 sec collar in scoring so that trivial alignment issues don’t penalize DER. When implementing more advanced steps like VB-HMM or EEND, definitely keep the relevant paper handy – you’ll need to match their described approach (e.g., how VB-HMM does inference) with your code. Essentially, treat the development as an iterative research process: implement -> test -> read/think -> refine.

**9. Testing on Unseen Data and Final Evaluation:** Finally, test the diarization system on completely unseen data (could be from the same dataset’s test set or a different dataset). Compute the DER. It’s helpful to compare your approach with a known baseline – for example, run Pyannote’s pretrained diarization on the same data and see how your DER compares. If your DER is within a reasonable range (say not too far off from published results for that dataset), you’ve done well. If not, analyze the differences: perhaps your system consistently merges two particular speakers – maybe their voices are very similar, which might require a more complex model or additional adaptation. For any **error analysis**, it’s useful to listen to some of the output with the speaker labels to subjectively assess quality (sometimes DER can be high due to very minor errors while the output “sounds” mostly correct, or vice versa). At this stage, also consider computational performance: with your MacBook, can the system run in near real-time? If not and that’s a goal, you might optimize some parts (e.g., use smaller models or batch processing of features). Otherwise, if accuracy is the main goal, consider ensembling techniques – e.g., combining embeddings: some research has used both MFCC+i-vector and x-vector together to leverage complementary strengths ([ISCA Archive - Diarization is Hard: Some Experiences and Lessons Learned for the JHU Team in the Inaugural DIHARD Challenge](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2018/sell18_interspeech.html#:~:text=diarization%20methods%2C%20such%20as%20training,approach%20to%20diarization%20performance%20measurement)).

By following these steps, referring to resources at each stage, you will progressively build a diarization system while deepening your understanding. Remember that diarization error rate around 10-20% is common even for good systems on challenging audio ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=error%20metric%20is%20the%20diarization,system%20can%20identify%20and%20attribute)) ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=To%20illustrate%20the%20importance%20of,file%20as%20being%20from%20the)) – so set realistic goals and celebrate improvements (each 1% DER reduction can be significant).

## Additional Resources

- **Academic Courses and Lectures:** If you prefer a structured course, look for *Speech Processing* or *Speaker Recognition* courses from universities. For example, **Stanford’s CS224S** or **Oxford’s Deep Learning for Speech and Language** may have segments on speaker recognition/diarization. The Johns Hopkins 2023 JSALT workshop had a focus on diarization (Hervé Bredin’s talk on YouTube ([Speaker diarization -- Herve Bredin -- JSALT 2023 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWdqxNDSg1k#:~:text=Speaker%20diarization%20,Ultimate%20Free%20AI%20Research%20Tool)) is essentially a mini-course). Additionally, Brno University of Technology (BUT) – a leading group in speaker recognition – has publicly available lectures/slides on speaker diarization (e.g., from their speaker recognition summer school). These can provide theoretical grounding and insights from competitive evaluations.

- **MOOCs and Tutorials:** While not very common, there are some MOOCs touching on this area. Coursera’s **Deep Learning for Audio** or **Advanced AI for Speech** might have a week on speaker diarization or at least on feature extraction and clustering in audio. Platforms like Udemy have a dedicated course “A Tutorial on Speaker Diarization” ([A Tutorial on Speaker Diarization - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/diarization/?srsltid=AfmBOooc7JWQQhKu520uYI440F8ULAp8_omNsU14ioBZU9exGun5vyNu#:~:text=A%20Tutorial%20on%20Speaker%20Diarization,academic%20advances%20in%20speaker%20diarization)), which covers basics through state-of-the-art – this could be a quick way to get pointers on implementations and common issues. Also, check out the **DeepLearning.AI** blogs or **Towards Data Science** for articles – often, practitioners write “tutorial” style blog posts on diarization implementation with code (search for terms like “speaker diarization Python tutorial”).

- **Project and Code Repositories:** Browse the GitHub repositories mentioned earlier (Pyannote, SpeechBrain, etc.) not just for usage but for how they’re implemented. For instance, reading through `pyannote.audio`’s code for speaker embedding model or how they do clustering can teach best practices. If you find that heavy, a simpler repository like **Rabbit** (just naming hypothetically) that someone published alongside a Master’s thesis might be easier to digest – search on GitHub for “speaker diarization PyTorch” to find personal projects. Often these personal projects have well-written READMEs that explain the approach, which can be enlightening.

- **Community Forums:** Engage with communities like the **Hugging Face forums** (there’s a thread for diarization as we saw) ([Diarization with unknown number of speakers - Models - Hugging Face Forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/diarization-with-unknown-number-of-speakers/17281#:~:text=number%20of%20speakers%20such%20as,Wav2Vec2ForAudioFrameClassification)), or Stack Overflow (tagged with speech or diarization). Many have faced the same issues (e.g., “how to determine number of speakers with clustering” ([Segmention instead of diarization for speaker count estimation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75833879/segmention-instead-of-diarization-for-speaker-count-estimation#:~:text=estimation%20stackoverflow,of%20speakers%20cannot%20be%20predetermined))) and you’ll find Q&A that can save you time. For example, a Hugging Face discussion might reveal how one user combined Wav2Vec2 and clustering and the pitfalls they encountered ([Diarization with unknown number of speakers - Models - Hugging Face Forums](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/diarization-with-unknown-number-of-speakers/17281#:~:text=number%20of%20speakers%20such%20as,Wav2Vec2ForAudioFrameClassification)).

- **Industry Blogs:** Companies working on transcription often blog about diarization. The Speechmatics blog we cited ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=which%20map%20the%20acoustic%20features,embeddings%20are%20obtained%2C%20the%20clustering)) ([Improving Speaker Diarization with Self-supervised Learning | Speechmatics](https://blog.speechmatics.com/ssl-diarization#:~:text=4,In%20such)) is a great read on modular vs end-to-end diarization and even discusses metrics like WDER vs DER. Similarly, AssemblyAI and AWS have posts on using diarization in practice (AssemblyAI’s API posts and AWS’s blog on using Pyannote with Sagemaker ([Deploy a Hugging Face (PyAnnote) speaker diarization model on ...](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploy-a-hugging-face-pyannote-speaker-diarization-model-on-amazon-sagemaker-as-an-asynchronous-endpoint/#:~:text=Deploy%20a%20Hugging%20Face%20,with%20Amazon%20SageMaker%20asynchronous%20endpoints)) give a sense of real-world deployment considerations). These resources can give insight into how diarization is used in products and any tricks to improve it (for instance, combining ASR and diarization output, or using language cues to assist diarization).

- **Papers and Proceedings:** Keep an eye on conference papers from **Interspeech** and **Odyssey (Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop)** – these often introduce the latest diarization techniques. A recent paper on **“Self-supervised diarization”** or **“Diarization with speaker embeddings and transformers”** can give you ideas to try (even if you don’t implement them fully, you might glean that, say, using augmentation during training helps, or that a certain loss function is beneficial). The *“Awesome Speaker Diarization”* GitHub list ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=kaldi,speaker%20diarization%20scripts%20using%20kaldi)) ([Awesome Speaker Diarization | awesome-diarization](https://wq2012.github.io/awesome-diarization/#:~:text=that%20does%20not%20require%20external,vector%20extractor%20recipe)) is a treasure trove, with sections for papers – use that as a map of the literature if you want to dive deeper into specific subtopics.

In summary, there’s a rich ecosystem of resources available. Start with fundamental concepts and simple code, then progressively incorporate more sophisticated methods as you learn. By utilizing open datasets, existing PyTorch models, and community knowledge, you’ll be able to develop a robust speaker diarization and transcription system even with limited compute resources. Good luck, and enjoy the journey of building “who spoke when” systems!
